An array of integers 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛
 is called a permutation if it contains each number from 1
 to 𝑛
 exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: [3,1,2]
, [1]
, [1,2,3,4,5]
 and [4,3,1,2]
. The following arrays are not permutations: [2]
, [1,1]
, [2,3,4]
.

Polycarp invented a really cool permutation 𝑝1,𝑝2,…,𝑝𝑛
 of length 𝑛
. It is very disappointing, but he forgot this permutation. He only remembers the array 𝑞1,𝑞2,…,𝑞𝑛−1
 of length 𝑛−1
, where 𝑞𝑖=𝑝𝑖+1−𝑝𝑖
.

Given 𝑛
 and 𝑞=𝑞1,𝑞2,…,𝑞𝑛−1
, help Polycarp restore the invented permutation.
