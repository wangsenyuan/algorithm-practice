A programming coach has n students to teach. We know that n is divisible by 3. Let's assume that all students are numbered from 1 to n, inclusive.

Before the university programming championship the coach wants to split all students into groups of three. For some pairs of students we know that they want to be on the same team. Besides, if the i-th student wants to be on the same team with the j-th one, then the j-th student wants to be on the same team with the i-th one. The coach wants the teams to show good results, so he wants the following condition to hold: if the i-th student wants to be on the same team with the j-th, then the i-th and the j-th students must be on the same team. Also, it is obvious that each student must be on exactly one team.

Help the coach and divide the teams the way he wants.
