This time, the pink soldiers have given you an integer 𝑥
 (𝑥≥2
).

Please determine if there exists a positive integer 𝑦
 that satisfies the following conditions.

𝑦
 is strictly less than 𝑥
.
There exists a non-degenerate triangle∗
 with side lengths 𝑥
, 𝑦
, 𝑥⊕𝑦
. Here, ⊕
 denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Additionally, if there exists such an integer 𝑦
, output any.
