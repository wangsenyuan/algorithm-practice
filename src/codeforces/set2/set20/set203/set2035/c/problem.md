Alya has been given a hard problem. Unfortunately, she is too busy running for student council. Please solve this problem for her.

Given an integer $n$, construct a permutation $p$ of integers $1, 2, \ldots, n$ that maximizes the value of $k$ (which is initially $0$) after the following process.

Perform $n$ operations, on the $i$-th operation ($i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$):

- If $i$ is odd, $k = k \& p_i$, where $\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operation.
- If $i$ is even, $k = k \mid p_i$, where $\mid$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($5 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of $k$ in the first line and output the permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ in the second line.

If there are multiple such permutations, output any.

## Example

### Input

```
6
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Output

```
5
2 1 3 4 5
7
1 2 4 6 5 3
7
2 4 5 1 3 6 7
15
2 4 5 1 3 6 7 8
9
2 4 5 6 7 1 3 8 9
15
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 10 9 7
```

## Note

For the first test case, the value of $k$ is determined as follows:

- $k = 0$ initially.
- On the 1st operation, $1$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k \& p_1 = 0 \& 2 = 0$.
- On the 2nd operation, $2$ is even, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k \mid p_2 = 0 \mid 1 = 1$.
- On the 3rd operation, $3$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k \& p_3 = 1 \& 3 = 1$.
- On the 4th operation, $4$ is even, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k \mid p_4 = 1 \mid 4 = 5$.
- On the 5th operation, $5$ is odd, so Alya sets $k$ to be $k \& p_5 = 5 \& 5 = 5$.

The final value of $k$ is $5$. It can be shown that the final value of $k$ is at most $5$ for all permutations of length $5$. Another valid output is $[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]$.

For the second test case, the final value of $k$ is $7$. It can be shown that the final value of $k$ is at most $7$ for all permutations of length $6$. Other valid outputs include $[2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 5]$ and $[5, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4]$.
