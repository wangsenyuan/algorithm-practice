Ivan has got an array of n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an. Ivan knows that the array is sorted in the non-decreasing order.

Ivan wrote out integers 2a1, 2a2, ..., 2an on a piece of paper. Now he wonders, what minimum number of integers of form 2b (b ≥ 0) need to be added to the piece of paper so that the sum of all integers written on the paper equalled 2v - 1 for some integer v (v ≥ 0).

Help Ivan, find the required quantity of numbers.
