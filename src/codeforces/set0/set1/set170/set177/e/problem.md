The Smart Beaver from ABBYY plans a space travel on an ultramodern spaceship. During the voyage he plans to visit n planets. For planet i ai is the maximum number of suitcases that an alien tourist is allowed to bring to the planet, and bi is the number of citizens on the planet.

The Smart Beaver is going to bring some presents from ABBYY to the planets he will be visiting. The presents are packed in suitcases, x presents in each. The Beaver will take to the ship exactly a1 + ... + an suitcases.

As the Beaver lands on the i-th planet, he takes ai suitcases and goes out. On the first day on the planet the Beaver takes a walk and gets to know the citizens. On the second and all subsequent days the Beaver gives presents to the citizens — each of the bi citizens gets one present per day. The Beaver leaves the planet in the evening of the day when the number of presents left is strictly less than the number of citizens (i.e. as soon as he won't be able to give away the proper number of presents the next day). He leaves the remaining presents at the hotel.

The Beaver is going to spend exactly c days traveling. The time spent on flights between the planets is considered to be zero. In how many ways can one choose the positive integer x so that the planned voyage will take exactly c days?
