### Problem Description

In the world of Deepwoken, there exists an ancient artifact — Tablet of Infinite Knowledge, on which a sequence of $n$ mysterious symbols (each symbol is an integer) is engraved.

It is said that the true power of the artifact can only be revealed by finding all sacred fragments — continuous segments of the tablet that contain exactly $k$ distinct numbers, and their length must be between $l$ and $r$ (inclusive).

**Formally:** Given a sequence $a$ of length $n$ and integers $k$, $l$, $r$. You need to find the number of such boundaries $b$ and $c$ such that:

- $1 \le b \le c \le n$
- among the elements $[a_b, a_{b+1}, \ldots, a_c]$ there are exactly $k$ distinct numbers
- $l \le c - b + 1 \le r$

### Input

Each test consists of several test cases.

The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 10^4)$ — the number of test cases.

The following describes the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers: $n$, $k$, $l$, and $r$ $(1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le l \le r \le n)$.

The second line contains $n$ numbers $a_i$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — the mysterious symbols.

It is guaranteed that the total value of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

### Output

For each test, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of continuous subarrays that meet the specified conditions.

### Example

#### Input
```
5
1 1 1 1
5
5 2 2 3
1 2 1 3 2
6 3 1 6
1 2 3 1 2 3
4 1 1 2
7 7 7 7
7 3 2 4
1 2 1 2 3 2 1
```

#### Output
```
1
5
10
7
5
```

### Note

**In the first test case** $a = [5]$, there is only one subarray $[5]$, which has a length of 1 and contains exactly 1 distinct number.

**In the fourth test case** $a = [7, 7, 7, 7]$, any subarray of identical numbers gives exactly 1 distinct number. The start and end of possible subarrays are:

- Length 1: $[1,1]$, $[2,2]$, $[3,3]$, $[4,4]$
- Length 2: $[1,2]$, $[2,3]$, $[3,4]$

In total: 7.

**In the fifth test case** $a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$:

- Length 2: all subarrays have only 2 distinct numbers
- Length 3: $[3,5]$, $[5,7]$
- Length 4: $[2,5]$, $[3,6]$, $[4,7]$

In total: 5.
