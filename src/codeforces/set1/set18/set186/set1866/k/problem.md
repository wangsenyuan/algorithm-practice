There is a tree of 𝑁
 vertices and 𝑁−1
 edges. The 𝑖
-th edge connects vertices 𝑈𝑖
 and 𝑉𝑖
 and has a length of 𝑊𝑖
.

Chaneka, the owner of the tree, asks you 𝑄
 times. For the 𝑗
-th question, the following is the question format:

𝑋𝑗
 𝐾𝑗
 – If each edge that contains vertex 𝑋𝑗
 has its length multiplied by 𝐾𝑗
, what is the diameter of the tree?
Notes:

Each of Chaneka's question is independent, which means the changes in edge length do not influence the next questions.
The diameter of a tree is the maximum possible distance between two different vertices in the tree.
