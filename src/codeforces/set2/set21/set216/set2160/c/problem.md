# Problem Description

Given a positive integer $x$, let $f(x)$ be the positive integer formed by reversing the binary representation of $x$ without leading zeroes. For example, if $x=12=1100_2$, then $f(x)=0011_2=3$.

You are given an integer $n$. Please determine if there exists a positive integer $x$ such that $x \oplus f(x) = n$*.

*Here, $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($0 \leq n < 2^{30}$).

## Output

For each test case, output YES if there exists a positive integer $x$ such that $x \oplus f(x) = n$, and NO otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" are also recognized as positive responses.

## Example

**Input:**

```text
6
0
3
6
8
10
11
```

**Output:**

```text
YES
YES
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

## Note

In the first case, when $x=1$, $f(x)=1$, and $x \oplus f(x) = 0$. Thus, the answer is YES.

In the second case, when $x=2$, $f(x)=1$, and $x \oplus f(x) = 3$. Thus, the answer is YES.

In the fourth test case, we can show there is no $x$ that satisfies $x \oplus f(x) = 8$, so the answer is NO.
