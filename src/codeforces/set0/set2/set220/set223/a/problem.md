A bracket sequence is a string, containing only characters "(", ")", "[" and "]".

A correct bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()[]", "([])" are correct (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+[1]", "([1+1]+1)"), and "](" and "[" are not. The empty string is a correct bracket sequence by definition.

A substring s[l... r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |s|) of string s = s1s2... s|s| (where |s| is the length of string s) is the string slsl + 1... sr. The empty string is a substring of any string by definition.

You are given a bracket sequence, not necessarily correct. Find its substring which is a correct bracket sequence and contains as many opening square brackets «[» as possible.

Input
The first and the only line contains the bracket sequence as a string, consisting only of characters "(", ")", "[" and "]". It is guaranteed that the string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 105 characters.

Output
In the first line print a single integer — the number of brackets «[» in the required bracket sequence. In the second line print the optimal sequence. If there are more than one optimal solutions print any of them.


### ideas
1. 有点像回文
2. s[i...j]是balanced时，就应该直接被选中
3. dp[j] = dp[i-1] + (s[i...j] 中间的]的数量) (i-1)也必须是一个balanced的结束位置
4.
