# Card Distribution Problem

## Problem Description

There are $n$ players sitting at the card table. Each player has a favorite number. The favorite number of the $j$-th player is $f_j$.

There are $k \cdot n$ cards on the table. Each card contains a single integer: the $i$-th card contains number $c_i$. Also, you are given a sequence $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_k$. Its meaning will be explained below.

The players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them will hold exactly $k$ cards. After all the cards are distributed, each player counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number. The joy level of a player equals $h_t$ if the player holds $t$ cards containing his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite number (i.e., $t = 0$), his joy level is $0$.

Print the maximum possible total joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the sequence $h_1, \ldots, h_k$ is the same for all the players.

## Input

The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 500, 1 \leq k \leq 10$) — the number of players and the number of cards each player will get.

The second line contains $k \cdot n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{k \cdot n}$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^5$) — the numbers written on the cards.

The third line contains $n$ integers $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n$ ($1 \leq f_j \leq 10^5$) — the favorite numbers of the players.

The fourth line contains $k$ integers $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_k$ ($1 \leq h_t \leq 10^5$), where $h_t$ is the joy level of a player if he gets exactly $t$ cards with his favorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition $h_{t-1} < h_t$ holds for each $t \in [2..k]$.

## Output

Print one integer — the maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card distributions.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
4 3
1 3 2 8 5 5 8 2 2 8 5 2
1 2 2 5
2 6 7
```

**Output:**
```
21
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
1 2 3
1 2 3
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

## Explanation

### Example 1

One possible optimal card distribution is the following:

- **Player 1** gets cards with numbers $[1, 3, 8]$;
- **Player 2** gets cards with numbers $[2, 2, 8]$;
- **Player 3** gets cards with numbers $[2, 2, 8]$;
- **Player 4** gets cards with numbers $[5, 5, 5]$.

Thus, the answer is $2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21$.

### Example 2

No player can get a card with his favorite number. Thus, the answer is $0$.
