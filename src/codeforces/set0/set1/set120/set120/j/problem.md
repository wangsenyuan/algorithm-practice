You are given a set of n vectors on a plane. For each vector you are allowed to multiply any of its coordinates by -1. Thus, each vector vi = (xi, yi) can be transformed into one of the following four vectors:

vi1 = (xi, yi),
vi2 = ( - xi, yi),
vi3 = (xi,  - yi),
vi4 = ( - xi,  - yi).
You should find two vectors from the set and determine which of their coordinates should be multiplied by -1 so that the absolute value of the sum of the resulting vectors was minimally possible. More formally, you should choose two vectors vi, vj (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, i ≠ j) and two numbers k1, k2 (1 ≤ k1, k2 ≤ 4), so that the value of the expression |vik1 + vjk2| were minimum.
