# Problem: String Rearrangement

Professor GukiZ doesn't accept string as they are. He likes to swap some letters in string to obtain a new one.

GukiZ has strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. He wants to obtain string `k` by swapping some letters in `a`, so that `k` should contain as many non-overlapping substrings equal either to `b` or `c` as possible. Substring of string `x` is a string formed by consecutive segment of characters from `x`. Two substrings of string `x` overlap if there is position `i` in string `x` occupied by both of them.

GukiZ was disappointed because none of his students managed to solve the problem. Can you help them and find one of possible strings `k`?

## Input

The first line contains string `a`, the second line contains string `b`, and the third line contains string `c` (1 ≤ |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ $10^5$, where |s| denotes the length of string s).

All three strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

It is possible that `b` and `c` coincide.

## Output

Find one of possible strings `k`, as described in the problem statement. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
aaa
a
b
```

**Output:**
```
aaa
```

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
pozdravstaklenidodiri
niste
dobri
```

**Output:**
```
nisteaadddiiklooprrvz
```

### Example 3

**Input:**
```
abbbaaccca
ab
aca
```

**Output:**
```
ababacabcc
```

## Note

In the third sample, this optimal solutions has three non-overlaping substrings equal to either `b` or `c` on positions 1 – 2 (`ab`), 3 – 4 (`ab`), 5 – 7 (`aca`). In this sample, there exist many other optimal solutions, one of them would be `acaababbcc`.


### ideas
1. b[0...25], c[0...25]分别表示数量
2. 假设有n个b，那么就可以计算出u个c，找出n+u的最大值
